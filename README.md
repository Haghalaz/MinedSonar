# Mined Sonar

## Description
Welcome to the Mined Sonar repository, a game inspired by the classic Minesweeper. This project was developed to illustrate the differences between code structured without a design pattern and another using the Atomic Design pattern.

## Objectives
Demonstrate the importance of using design patterns in building robust and scalable applications.
Provide a comparative study between an application without a design pattern and one using the Atomic Design pattern.
Facilitate learning about best practices in development and code organization.

## Features
Intuitive and interactive interface for playing Mined Sonar.
Example implementation without a design pattern.
Example implementation using the Atomic Design pattern.

## Repository Structure
 - main: Implementation of the game using the Atomic Design pattern with documentation and instructions.
 - without-pattern: Implementation of the game without a design pattern.
